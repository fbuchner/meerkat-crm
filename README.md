### Development
To set up this repository for development, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/fbuchner/perema.git
    cd perema
    ```

1. **Run the backend:**
Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) installed. Then, set up your environment configuration:
    ```sh
    cd backend
    # Copy the example environment file and configure it with your settings
    cp .env.example my_environment.env
    # Edit my_environment.env with your actual configuration values
    
    # Install dependencies and run
    go mod tidy
    source my_environment.env
    go run main.go
    ```
   The project uses an SQLite database for storage, which will be automatically created if it doesn't exist.

1. **Run the frontend (in a second terminal):**
    ```sh
    cd frontend
    yarn install
    yarn serve
    ```

You can also use the Debug button in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as configured in the launch.json file.
