# User Settings

## Language

Currently you can choose between **English** and **Deutsch** (German) for the application interface. The language change takes effect immediately. Your language preference is also used in the backend for email notifications (e.g., reminder emails). Backend messages (especially errors) always stay in English.


## Date Format

You can choose between the European (DD.MM.YYYY) and US (MM/DD/YYYY) date format. This affects all date displays and also determines the expected input format when entering dates like birthdays.


## Appearance

Choose your preference between light mode and dark mode. This setting is stored locally in your browser and is not synced across devices.


## Custom Field Names

Define custom fields that appear on all your contacts for tracking information that doesn't fit into the standard contact fields. You can change the order of the custom fields, though they will always be displayed after the standard fields.
